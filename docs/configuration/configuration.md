# ScubaGear Configuration File

ScubaGear uses a single consolidated configuration file to specify all parameters and settings for the `Invoke-SCuBA` cmdlet. The path to this file is provided via the `-ConfigFilePath` parameter, and the file must be formatted as YAML. All configuration for ScubaGear—including product-specific settings, policy exclusions, and metadata—should be included in this one file.

- The configuration file allows you to set or override any supported ScubaGear parameter, as well as embed additional fields for supplemental metadata.
- All variable names use Pascal case and are consistent with the parameters used by ScubaGear.
- If a parameter is specified both on the command line and in the configuration file, the command line value takes precedence.

## Sample Configuration File

A comprehensive example is provided in [`full_config.yaml`](../../PowerShell/ScubaGear/Sample-Config-Files/full_config.yaml). This file demonstrates all supported parameters and configuration options, including product-specific settings, policy exclusions, and metadata fields.

To use ScubaGear with your configuration file:

```powershell
Invoke-SCuBA -ConfigFilePath full_config.yaml
```

You may override any parameter at the command line as needed:

```powershell
Invoke-SCuBA -ConfigFilePath full_config.yaml -ProductNames defender
```

## Generating a Sample Configuration File

You can generate a template configuration file using the `New-SCuBAConfig` cmdlet. This will create a `SampleConfig.yaml` file with all available options, which you can then edit to suit your environment.

```powershell
New-SCuBAConfig
```

## Omitting Policies

To omit specific policies from ScubaGear evaluation (for example, if a policy is not applicable to your organization), use the `OmitPolicy` top-level key in your configuration file. Omitted policies will appear as "Omitted" in the HTML report and will be colored gray. For each omitted policy, you can specify:

- `Rationale`: The reason for omitting the policy (displayed in the report).
- `Expiration`: (Optional) A date after which the policy should no longer be omitted (format: yyyy-mm-dd).

**Omitting policies should only be done with appropriate risk management approval, as it may introduce blind spots in your assessment.**

## Product-Specific Configuration

All product-specific configuration is now included in the single configuration file. For example, Entra ID, Defender, and Exchange Online settings are specified under their respective top-level keys. See the `full_config.yaml` for examples.

### Entra ID Example

```yaml
Aad:
  MS.AAD.1.1v1:
    CapExclusions:
      Users:
        - <user-guid>
      Groups:
        - <group-guid>
```

### Defender Example

```yaml
Defender:
  MS.DEFENDER.1.4v1:
    SensitiveAccounts:
      IncludedUsers:
        - <user-guid>
      ExcludedGroups:
        - <group-guid>
```

### Exchange Online Example

```yaml
Exo:
  MS.EXO.1.1v2:
    AllowedForwardingDomains:
      - example.com
      - partner.org
```

## YAML Anchors and Aliases

YAML [anchors and aliases](https://smcleod.net/2022/11/yaml-anchors-and-aliases/) can be used within your configuration file to avoid repeating values. For example:

```yaml
CommonSensitiveAccountFilter: &CommonSensitiveAccountFilter
  IncludedUsers:
    - <user-guid>
  ExcludedGroups:
    - <group-guid>

Defender:
  MS.DEFENDER.1.4v1:
    SensitiveAccounts: *CommonSensitiveAccountFilter
  MS.DEFENDER.1.5v1:
    SensitiveAccounts: *CommonSensitiveAccountFilter
```

Using anchors and aliases is optional, but can help keep your configuration DRY and maintainable.

## Muting Version Check Warnings

To prevent ScubaGear from checking for newer releases and emitting a warning at import time, set the environment variable `SCUBAGEAR_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` to any non-whitespace value.

**Note:** All configuration is now managed in a single file. Please refer to [`full_config.yaml`](../../PowerShell/ScubaGear/Sample-Config-Files/full_config.yaml) for the latest structure and options.
