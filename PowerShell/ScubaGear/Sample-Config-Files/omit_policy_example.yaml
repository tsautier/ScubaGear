  This configuration shows a standard SCuBAGear set of parameters to run
  but also includes examples of configuring specific policies to be omitted
  from the ScubaGear output. Any omitted policies should be carefully considered
  and documented as part of an organization's cybersecurity risk management
  program process and practices.

# results (e.g., for controls that are met using a third party tool).

# Note:  This section is used to omit policies from the assessment from any product.
#       The policies listed here will not be included in the assessment results.
#       You must provide a rationale for each omitted policy."
